# Homework 1

Guidelines: Homeworks should be clear and legible, with answers clearly indicated and work shown. Homeworks will be given a minus, check, or check plus owing to completion and correctness. You are welcome to work with others but please submit your own work. Your homework must be produced in an R Markdown (.rmd) file submitted via github. If you are having trouble accomplishing this, please refer to the [guide](http://spia.uga.edu/faculty_pages/tyler.scott/teaching/PADP8120_Fall2015/Homeworks/submitting_homework.shtml). This homework is adapted from the work of Jenny Bryan (http://www.stat.ubc.ca/~jenny/STAT545A/current.html)


Topics covered in this homework include:

- Data manipulation and exploration in R
- Making a document in R Markdown
- Version control

(the last two elements will be covered by the fact that you are required to produce your homework in R Markdown and submit it via github)

The goal is to manipulate and explore a dataset with the `dplyr` package, complemented by visualizations made with `ggplot2`. In particular, we keep our focus on working with a `data.frame` (but note: `dplyr` can work with other data storage formats seamlessly). Your homework should serve as your own personal cheatsheet in the future for ways to manipulate a dataset and produce companion figures. Give yourself the cheatsheet you deserve!

## Part A - Load gapminder data

Work with the [Gapminder excerpt](http://tiny.cc/gapminder) maintained by Jenny Bryan at UBC (i.e., the first part of this task will be to figure out how to load these data). Import the data with `read.delim()` and with `read.table()`. FYI: `read.delim()` is just a wrapper around `read.table()` with specific arguments set to certain values. [Read the documentation!](http://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/functions/read.table)

  * Load the Gapminder data with both functions without specifying args other than `file`. Do you get the same resulting object in your workspace? Use all the ways we've learned to inspect an object to back up your claims with hard facts.
  * If you're not getting the same object, why not?
  * Develop the call to `read.table()` that is equivalent to `read.delim()`, i.e. how do you need to set various arguments and describe this in prose as well.

## Part B - Data smell test

Explore your new data.frame.

  * Is it a data.frame, a matrix, a vector, a list?
  * What's its mode, class?
  * How many variables?
  * How many rows/observations?
  * Can you get these facts about "extent" or "size" in more than one way? Can you imagine different functions being useful in different contexts?
  
## Part C - Explore individual variables

Pick __at least__ one categorical variable and at least one quantitiative variable to explore.

  * Characterize what's possible, i.e. all possible values or max vs. min ... whatever's appropriate.
  * What's typical? What's the spread? What's the distribution? Etc., tailored to the variable at hand.
  * Feel free to use summary stats, tables, figures. Don't worry about high production values. 
  
## Part D - Getting down to business

Attack each of the tasks below with a table and figure.

  * Base R tools (e.g., `subset`, logicals) and `dplyr` should be your main data manipulation tools
  * `ggplot2` should be your main visualization tool
  
Make observations about what your tables/figures show and about the process.

If you want to do something comparable but different, i.e. swap one quantitative variable for another, be my guest! If you are feeling inspired and curious, then we're doing this right. Go for it.

Relax about the following things:

  * Tidying/reshaping is NOT your assignment. Many of your tables will be awkwardly shaped in the report. That's OK.
  * Table beauty is not a big deal. Simply printing to "screen" is fine. You could also try the `knitr::kable()` function. Assuming `my_df` is a data.frame, here's an R chunk that should print it as a decent-looking table:

<pre><code>```{r results = 'asis'}
knitr::kable(my_df)
```</code></pre>

  * For all things, graphical and tabular, if you're dissatisfied with a result, discuss the problem, what you've tried and move on.

### Task menu

1. Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

2. Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

3. Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean.

4. How is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?

5. Report the absolute and/or relative abundance of countries with low life expectancy over time by continent: Compute some measure of worldwide life expectancy – you decide – a mean or median or some other quantile or perhaps your current age. The determine how many countries on each continent have a life expectancy less than this benchmark, for each year.

6. Find countries with interesting stories. Open-ended and, therefore, hard. Promising but unsuccessful attempts are encouraged. This will generate interesting questions to follow up on in class.

### Companion graphs

For each table, make sure to include a relevant figure.

Your figure does not have to depict every last number from the data aggregation result. Use your judgement. It just needs to complement the table, add context, and allow for some sanity checking both ways.

Notice which figures are easy/hard to make, which data formats make better inputs for plotting functions vs. for human-friendly tables.

### Report your process

You're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc. Give credit to your sources, whether it's a blog post, a fellow student, an online tutorial, etc.

### Submit the assignment

Follow instructions on [How to submit homework](hw00_homework-guidelines.html#how-to-submit-homework)

### Rubric


Minus: Didn't tackle at least 3 tasks. Or didn't make companion graphs. Didn't interpret anything but left it all to the "reader". Or more than one technical problem that is relatively easy to fix. It's hard to find the report in our repo.

Check: Completed, but not fully accurate and/or readable. Requires a bit of detective work on my part to see what you did

Check plus: Hits all the elements. No obvious mistakes. Pleasant to read. No heroic detective work required. Solid.

Overachiever! (no extra credit, but you will recieve my admiration): Exceeded the requirements in number of tasks. Or developed novel tasks that were indeed interesting and "worked". Impressive use of `dplyr` and/or `ggplot2`. Impeccable organization of repo and report. You learned something new from reviewing their work and you're eager to incorporate it into your work.

#### The command below is helpful for debugging, please don't change it

```{r echo=FALSE}
sessionInfo()
```
